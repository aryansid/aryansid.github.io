        <h3>Thought To Image: Using EEG signals to classify images</h3>
        <p>Abstract: We explore the use of Electroencephalograms
          (EEGs) for image classification with the
          intention of enhancing thought-to-image conversion
          techniques. Using a dataset of EEG segments,
          images, and image class labels, we applied
          various classifiers‚Äîsuch as Random Forest‚Äîas
          well as dimensionality reduction techniques like
          channel selection and EEG-specific features. We
          found the most success training a Random Forest
          classifier on select extracted features, which
          yielded an accuracy of 47%. With recent nondeep-
          learning state-of-the-art models achieving
          accuracies in the 20-30% range, we conclude that
          combining classifiers with channel selection and
          feature extraction techniques has significant potential
          as a fast and lightweight means of enhancing
          thought-to-image conversion systems. Performance
          may be further amplified in conjunction
          with deep learning techniques.</p>

        <h3>GAN Inspired LLMs for Spear Phishing</h3>
        <p>Abstract: Spear phishing‚Äôs menace is exacerbated by the manual
          and template-reliant methods for crafting such
          emails‚Äîuntil now. Current integration of
          Large Language Models (LLMs) into spear phishing
          still demands manual prompting,
          a bottleneck for scalability and adaptability. 
          Our study breaks new ground by introducing
          a self-improving system that leverages LLMs to autonomously
          learn and generate the prompts required
          for crafting personalized phishing emails. This selfprompting
          mechanism, inspired by Generative Adversarial
          Network (GAN) architectures,
          marks a departure from the manual prompt
          engineering that plagues existing models. Our approach
          automates the iterative refinement of prompts, enhancing
          the relevance and efficacy of the phishing content.
          By instituting novel performance metrics, we chart a
          new course in automated phishing endeavors, with our
          manual evaluations pointing towards unprecedented success
          rates. This paper delves into our self-prompting
          framework, its evaluation, and its potential to redefine
          the landscape of cyber threats.</p>
